    This function use ODE to model how a new disease spreads throughout a population.
    Inputs:
        N: population size
        i0: the fraction of the infectious population at time 0
        t: number of iterations
        b: the number of interactions each day that could spread the disease (per individual)
        k: the fraction of the infectious population which recovers each day
    Return:
        s: the fraction of the susecptible population at time t
        i: the fraction of the infectious population at time t
