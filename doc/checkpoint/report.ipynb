    "\n",
    "Comparing the phase diagrams at three time points, we can see a consistent conclusion with facet diagram. For example,\n",
    "* for `t = 5`, at the early period, `b` has a significant effect on `i`. A small change (eg. from `b = 1` to `b = 2`) will result a large increase in `i`.\n",
