If one member is interested in PDEs, they might propose improvements to the continuous model. You might also propose replicating a computational experiment in a a paper related to this topic. In general, you should propose variations that will be fairly straightforward to implement, since you might start to drift into research territory otherwise. You do not need to be exhaustive - the point is just to try out a few different ideas."
