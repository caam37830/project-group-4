The middel point ps indicate agents can freely move around in any direction. Thus, even starting at the corner, the infected people are likely to get to the center at anytime point. With p really samll (we set extreme to 0 in this case,) since corner infected can only infect 1/4 of the people around, the spread is much lower than center/random starts. What's more, we can see with some extreme cases, infected might even not be able to spread the virus, with all of them getting recovered without further infection. We also notice that no matter what starting point is, lower mobility (either extreme large p or small p,) results lower infections rate and spread spead.

    "* the role of `p` differs for the agent-based model and the PDE model. In PDE, `p` is the weight of the Laplacian term, so larger `p` corresponds to faster spread. In agent-based model, however, the rate of spread would first increase and then decrease as `p` increases. This is because too large a `p`, similar as too small a `p`, restricts the movement of the population. For example, if `p > sqrt(2)`, then all infectious individuals would never move away from where they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "* if we fix the interesting `p` (again, the interesting `p` is different for the two models), we would observe that the initial infection at the center is much more effective than the initial infection at the corner. This makes sense because infectious individuals at the center would have more space to move around and infect more people, while infectious individuals at the corner are kind of limited in their movements."
