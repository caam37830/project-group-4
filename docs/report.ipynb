We then explore the spatial SIR model with the set of chosen parameters, where we solve the model using the agent-based model and the PDE model, and study the effect of the diffusion parameter and the starting position on the evolvement of the infectious population. We then move on to the three variations we proposed in the midterm checkpoint. Finally, we present our findings by studying these models and our discussion on the limitations and improvements of these models."

The middel point ps indicate agents can freely move around in any direction. Thus, even starting at the corner, the infected people are likely to get to the center at anytime point. With p really samll (we set extreme to 0 in this case,) since corner infected can only infect 1/4 of the people around, the spread is much lower than center/random starts. What's more, we can see with some extreme cases, infected might even not be able to spread the virus, with all of them getting recovered without further infection. We also notice that no matter what starting point is, lower mobility (either extreme large p or small p,) results lower infections rate and spread spead.

In agent-based model, however, the rate of spread would first increase and then decrease as `p` increases. This is because too large a `p`, similar as too small a `p`, restricts the movement of the population. For example, if `p > sqrt(2)`, then all infectious individuals would never move away from where they are.\n",
