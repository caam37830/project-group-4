The middel point ps indicate agents can freely move around in any direction. Thus, even starting at the corner, the infected people are likely to get to the center at anytime point. With p really samll (we set extreme to 0 in this case,) since corner infected can only infect 1/4 of the people around, the spread is much lower than center/random starts. What's more, we can see with some extreme cases, infected might even not be able to spread the virus, with all of them getting recovered without further infection.
