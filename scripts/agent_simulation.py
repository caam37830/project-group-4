Because we're investigating how a new disease spreads, you can start with
a small number of infectious individuals (e.g. 0.1% of the population)
for both the continuous and discrete simulations, with the remainder of
the population in the susceptible category.

# dennis: let's use N = 1000 and initial infectious fraction = 0.1%

Your simulations should produces some plots of how s, i, and r change over
the length of the simulation for a couple different choices of k and b.

# dennis: include title, axis labels, legend. can try some extreme values of k and b

You should also investigate the qualitative behavior of the simulations based on
the parameters b and k in a phase diagram. For instance, how does the
total percentage of the population infected at some point in the simulation
depend on these parameters? Are there parameter regimes where i quickly goes
to 0? Are there parameter regimes where everyone is eventually infected?
